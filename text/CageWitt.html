    <p>The connection between John Cage and Wittgenstein’s ideas of silence in language and music.</p>
    <pre>
        The connection between John Cage and Wittgenstein’s ideas of silence in language and music.

John Cage and Ludwig Wittgenstein, whilst existing in wildly different academic and vocational spaces, seem to strike up interesting lines of connection between their bodies of works. The majority of these connections come about through the inseparable link between language and music. This essay will be an exploration on the connection between the views on silence held by both Wittgenstein and Cage and how far the analogy can be drawn between silence (and indeed non-silence) in language and music generally.

For the first section of the essay I will focus on direct comparison between the two most central points of ‘silence’ in Cage and Wittgenstein’s work. For Cage this is of course his famous silent piece ‘4’33’, for Wittgenstein the invocation of silence in the final proposition (proposition 7)  in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: “7: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof we must be silent”. The first main section identifies three main points of direct analogy and comparison between these two works, the firsts of which being a shared intention or goal (that in itself will help make clear the definition of ‘silence’ to Cage and Wittgenstein). This intention/aim being both works, Cage’s ‘silent piece’ and Wittgenstein’s ‘Tractatus’, acting as a demarcation of the limits to their respective subjects. 

i.

To Wittgenstein, silence is what should fall in place of ‘non-sense’. The Tractatus itself is attempting to work backwards from the outer layer of the circle of factual language to its centre, atomic facts. Then by means of logic he worked outwards to the limit of this circle so to speak. It then can be said that what lies outside this circle of possible factual discourse is the silence that Wittgenstein evokes with his final proposition. But this ‘silence’ needs to be described in more than just this way. David Pears (scholar and translator of Wittgenstein’s works) puts this very neatly:

“For as Wittgenstein points out later in the Tractatus, there is no other side to the limit, and so the task of plotting it is more like calculating the curvature of space itself. If the sense of factual propositions are points in logical space, ‘non-sense’ is nowhere.” 

 Where does this leave the notion of Wittgenstein’s silence? It seems rather ironically that this idea of silence does not pass innocently or silently at all. Rather it seems, if we are to take silence as to be the proper replacement for everything that lies outside Wittgenstein’s factual discourse (non-sense), that it reduces all religious, philosophical, ethical and metaphysical discussion to non-sense. In light of this, it is important to note that Wittgenstein, by refusing to locate the truths of religion and morality within factual discourse, was not rejecting them outright but trying to separate them from the certainties of other subjects such as the natural sciences. They are non-sense only because they lack factual sense but to make this point is not to say they are to be completely dismissed. Other than these apparent implications upon philosophical discourse, the most important notion of Wittgenstein’s silence is that it is the demarcation of logical space, or perhaps more accurately that logical space demarcates all that should be passed over in silence.
Now looking at John Cage’s 4’33, we can determine a similar affinity in the understanding of logical space in his ‘silent piece’. This silent piece exists in an open space of possible sound whilst never itself partaking in musical articulation. To understand how Cage’s silent piece reflects this notion of logical space we can look to how he describes what silence is. Cage does not view silence in terms of the negative; it is not the absence of sound. He makes clear that silence can not be heard as, for Cage, there is no such thing as real silence; however silence is there.

“What interests me far more than anything that happens is the fact of how it would be if nothing were happening. Now, I want things that happen to not erase the spirit that was already there without anything happening. Now, this thing that I mean when I say not anything happening is what I call silence, that is to say, a state of affairs free of intention, because we always have sounds, for instance. Therefore we don't have any silence available in the world. We're in a world of sounds. We call it silence, when we don't feel a direct connection with the intentions that produce sounds. We say that it's quiet, when, due to our non-intention, there don't seem to us to be many sounds. When there seem to us to be many, we say that it's noisy. But there is no real essential difference between a noisy silence and a quiet silence. The thing that runs through from the quietness to the noise is a state of non-intention, and it is this state that interests me.” 

Following from this, we can determine that Cage does not picture silence on the scale from extreme quiet to extreme loudness, silence is not just another sound or type of sound to be heard. Neither is it merely the absence of sound, the zero on the volume scale. Silence is a state of possibility in which sounds may arise or fall away from. Perhaps here we can draw the first connecting line between Cage’s view of silence and Wittgenstein’s philosophy. Wittgenstein throughout the ‘2.0n’ propositions highlights the notion of logical space and possible space. 

“2.0131: A spatial object must be situated in infinite space. A speck in the visual field, though it need not be red, must have some colour: it is, so to speak, surrounded by colour space. Notes must have some pitch, objects of the sense of touch some degree of hardness, and so on.”

Cage’s notion of silence holds similarities to Wittgenstein’s notion of possible space. Silence does not exist within the ‘sound space’ but perhaps Cage’s silence can be interpreted as the sound space in which all points of sound occupy. In the previous proposition Witgenstein states:

“2.013: Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible states of affairs. This space I can imagine empty, but I cannot imagine the thing without the space.”

In still pursuing the connection between Cage’s silence and Wittgenstein’s infinite space, one may be inclined to object that it seems possible to imagine a state of affairs with only sound and no silence. In fact Cage even states himself that silence is in fact never possible, there “is no silence available in the world”. This then makes clear the importance of sound “intention” and “non-intention” in Cage’s musical philosophy.

“We call it silence, when we don't feel a direct connection with the intentions that produce sounds.” ³

 The experience of silence comes when one is disconnected with “the intentions that produce sound”. So, seemingly, in a world of perpetual noise, no matter the physical auditory content, every point of sound still has to exist surrounded by silence (which in Wittgenstein’s terminology can be equated to ‘sound space’). It can then be said that the piece ‘4’33’ is perhaps an attempt at revealing this musical space as it is in itself, without focusing on the contents of that space. By instantiating this open space of musical possibility, Cage allows for the listeners attention, without discrimination, to be focused towards all sound. Perhaps this is how Cage approaches the task of “not erasing the spirit that was already there without anything happening” within a composition; in essence maintaining the silent spirit of “nothing happening”³ in a world where this is not a possibility.


ii. 

Features of Cage’s ‘4’33’ can also be revealed by examining parts of Wittgenstein’s general theory of representation commonly known as the ‘picture theory of language’. The word ‘picture’ here is slightly misleading when tasked with comparing Wittgenstein’s linguistic and propositional philosophy to the compositional and musical philosophy of Cage. One may be tempted to conjure analogies trying to connect pictures (as in images) to the sentences and propositions that Wittgenstein describes, when the more fitting concept in this case would be ‘models’. As Wittgenstein says himself:

“3.1431: The essential nature of the propositional sign becomes very clear when we imagine it made up of spacial objects (such as tables, chairs, books) instead of written signs.”

Wittgenstein’s theory of representation rests on the isomorphic nature between a proposition and the reality which it represents or ‘pictures’. This notion struck Wittgenstein when he witnessed proceedings in a courtroom in which a miniature model was used to portray the events of a car accident. Wittgenstein observed that the model used in court succeeded in acting as a representation of reality because both the model and reality had precisely the same amount of moving parts and precisely the same amount of ways those moving parts could be arranged. The parts of the model were moveable; the positions we put the model people and cars on the model pavement and street represent the positions that the real people and cars were on the real pavement and street. Granted, the ways in which we move the objects of the model (by picking them up and placing them with our hands) is very different from the ways the real cars and people are moved, nevertheless the positions these models take up are what is essential to the representation - not how they arrive at these positions. This is the first step towards Wittgenstein’s notion of logical form. The reason why the model can represent the reality is because of the shared underlying logical form. Wittgenstein states that what all states of affairs and objects share, no matter the form of the space they inhibit (spacial, visual etc.) is a logical form. 

“2.033: Form is the possibility of structure.”

The form of a proposition is the possibility for it’s constituents to be arranged in the ways they can be arranged. Through this idea we can see how it’s possible for musical ideas to be translated through different notational forms. For example, how a chord can be depicted using standard clef notation or in the TAB notation for a guitar. Although the format of these notations are completely different, the constituent parts of what is being represented (the individual notes that make up the chord, the pitch of these notes, the duration etc.) can be mapped one-to-one between these notational forms.

Figure 1: Standard notation and TAB here represent the exact same musical idea with differing formats and irregularities associated with these formats.

Although every proposition shares a logical form, translations between the previously noted “infinite spaces” (colour space, visual space, temporal space etc.) do not seem to be possible provided the moving parts and possible arrangements of the constituents do not match up one-to-one. For example it would seem impossible to precisely translate the C major chord (as seen above) into colour space while maintaining the articulate meaning of the musical idea. The chord is translatable throughout different musical notations because these musical formats all have the same capacity to convey musical ideas, much like all languages from across the world have the same capacity to communicate concepts. The possible arrangement of the moving parts (the form) stays consistent. There are apparent irregularities in each format, for example the use of sharps and flats in standard notation seems to have no equivalent in guitar TAB, however, these symbols refer to one and the same underlying reality of musical notation and do not impair the meaning that is conveyed, it is merely conveyed in a different manner. Wittgenstein even uses this example of sharps and flats to communicate this idea in the Tractatus:

“4.014: And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial character, we see that it is not impaired by apparent irregularities (such as the use of # and b in musical notation). For even these irregularities depict what they are intended to express; only they do it in a different way.” 

The guitar TAB and standard musical notation both share the same musical form (the same possible arrangements of the constituent parts). Each are both pictures in Wittgenstein’s terminology, pictures that have (and exist within) musical form. This idea of form further clarifies the boundaries and limits of translation; it shows the reason why the C major chord cannot be represented through colour or spatially represented.

“2.171: A picture can depict any reality whose form it has. A spatial picture can depict anything spacial, a coloured one anything coloured etc.”

In this way, John Cage’s 4’33 seems to transcend Wittgenstein’s internal boundaries of form. If we imagine each moving part of a picture as a point in the formal space it inhabits then it is fair to say that Cage’s silent piece is devoid of any of these points (or perhaps we can say it has only one point, that being: the fact that it is empty). Then, it can be discerned that whilst 4’33 inherently has musical form and exists in sound space it lacks the internal multiplicity that would prevent it from being 
translated or communicated in other formal spaces. As the piece has no moving parts there is no criteria to restrict it from being communicated in colour space, or as a spatial picture. This idea is supported in Cage’s own musings on Rauschenberg’s ‘White paintings’. John Cage says himself:

“The White paintings came first; my silent piece came later”. 

James Fielding considers this idea of formal equivalence in these two works in his article ‘An Aesthetics of the Ordinary’:

“Perhaps Cage had good reason to note of Robert Rauschenberg's White Paintings. If Cage felt obliged to acknowledge that Rauschenberg's White Paintings came first, it can thus be argued that this is not merely an acknowledgment of the historically situated development of  avant-garde aesthetics. Rather, if it is necessary for Cage to acknowledge Rauschenberg's
"silent piece" in reference to his own, it is perhaps also because they are, in this formal sense, the same work. In other words, both works say the same thing: to wit, nothing.” 

However, there is a subtle difference between Cage and Rauschenberg’s understanding of their respective works that holds some relevance to this idea of silence. To John Cage, the empty score merely frames what is the true work, that being the unintentional sounds that arise during the a performance of ‘4’33’.

“A cough or a baby cry will not ruin a good piece of modern music” 

Similarly, the unintentional specs of paint or dust, along with the way light and shadow hits Rauschenberg’s white paintings would be the meaningful content of them for Cage. For example, the 4’33 performed by Cage in a concert hall will be very different to the 4’33 played from my phone speakers, or the cover of 4’33 performed by a death metal band.

On the other hand, Rauschenberg suggested that his ‘white works’ should be repainted to keep them fresh, suggesting that in his mind the true content of the piece should exclusively be an appreciation of the blank, open plane of possible form. Nevertheless, the notion of form and structure and how form is the possibility of structure seems relevant to the understanding of both pieces.

iii.

Whilst the general theory of representation develops a solid foundational link between the propositions of factual discourse and the realities they attempt to convey, the aim of the Tractatus was not purely an effort in describing these ways in which language pointed to reality. Wittgenstein also wanted to give an account of the logical framework or ‘scaffolding’ that cemented the logical form and structure of language mentioned previously. This of course is a daunting task, especially considering the earlier notions of the Tractatus in which Wittgenstein stated that this logical form can never be pictured or conveyed using propositions, it can only be shown. John Cage’s ‘4’33’ acted, in the previous example of Wittgenstein’s “infinite” and “logical space”, as a useful analogy, almost providing a sense of a physical and ‘real’ instantiation of Wittgenstein’s concepts (which is unhelpfully lacking even in the Tractatus itself). Fortunately, Cage’s silent piece also acts as a fruitful source of comparison to the notions of logical framework/scaffolding. 

This logical framework is built from the notions of tautology and contradiction, which act as two sides of a linguistic extreme. Whilst contradiction marks an external boundary of factual language, tautology marks an internal one.

“5.143: Contradiction, one might say, vanishes outside all propositions: tautology vanishes inside them”

What grounds this limit of language as well as Wittgenstein’s notions of tautology and contradiction is the same idea that gives propositions sense in the first place. This single fundamental idea is the idea of exclusion. A valid proposition will always shut out some possible state of affairs. In the simplest form: the proposition p has to shut out the proposition not-p. It is not that this proposition has the supernatural power to eliminate ‘not-p’ from existence but rather, if that proposition is to be true, it will assert ‘not-p’ to be false. In this example it is important to distinguish the impossibility of there being ‘half-p’ (a proposition in between p and not-p) by logical necessity. This exclusion of half-p is different from the exclusion of not-p: the former is exclusion by logical necessity as half-p cannot be the case, whereas not-p could have been the case. This outlines some subtlety to Wittgenstein’s logical framework as he would need to give an account of factual propositions that also explained this logical necessity. He had to find a connection between what is shut out by a factual proposition and what is excluded by a logical proposition. Without venturing into the logical backing of Wittgenstein’s theory, it can be said that the connection Wittgenstein found was that what factual propositions shut out is something, whereas what logical propositions shut out is nothing; that logical necessity marks the true conceptual limit of language. Now to describe what is meant by tautology and contradiction we can say that a tautology shuts out no possible state of affairs and so is true in all conceivable circumstances (like saying, this cup is either red or not red), a contradiction is one that excludes all possible states of affairs (like saying this cup is neither red nor not-red). According to Wittgenstein, contradictions and tautologies say nothing because they have no truth condition: they are unconditionally true or false. In this way we can say that tautologies and contradictions have no sense but we cannot say they are non-sense as we are still able to connect them in some way with the states of affairs they exclude. They say nothing but according to Wittgenstein they do not do nothing. Wittgenstein states that 

“6.1: The propositions of logic are tautologies”

The fact that propositions can connect to yield tautologies shows a definite structure of language; the fact that when they are so connected they do yield tautology shows that they themselves possess the properties of this structure. In this sense it is the tautologies (and their counterpart contradictions) that trace this border of factual discourse. 

	Turning back now to Cage’s ‘4’33’ it can perhaps be said that this piece shows a similar tracing of the limits of music. ‘4’33’ holds a similar formal structure to that of a tautology and a similar performative structure to that of contradiction. The score of the piece is composed in accordance with the formal structure of notation and yet the score itself does not distinguish any musical articulation; it admits all sound and excludes none akin to something of a musical tautology. In the performative sense, the piece is performed only by not performing it at all, hence the contradiction. Through the lens of Wittgenstein's logical framework we can say that 4’33 is senseless in the fact that it says nothing (due to these notions of tautology and contradiction), however it would be overstepping to say that it is meaningless or at least that it serves no purpose. Alike to how Wittgenstein’s factual and logical propositions show the logical structure of language, perhaps Cage’s ‘4’33’ shows the logical structure of music.

“Any sounds of any qualities and pitches (known or unknown, definite or indefinite), any context of these, simple or multiple, are natural and conceivable within a rhythmic structure which equally embraces silence.” 

Cage reveals silence to be not only the outer limit of music, but also that which shows music its structure; he reveals it to show the form of music.

iv.

Up until now there has been an assumed method of comparison and analogy between the factual discourse of Wittgenstien’s concern and the musical composition of Cage. The three links discussed between the Tractatus and ‘4’33’ (1. Shared intention 2. Logical space/translation 3. Tautology and logical scaffolding) although helpful in shedding light onto Wittgenstein and Cage’s individual ideas, have an air of superficiality about them as it has not yet been shown how the structures of music can connect at all to the propositional language that Wittgenstein holds in question. A connection can first be made in the way Wittgenstein talks of musical language and propositional language being two species of the same thing. In fact, Wittgenstein on multiple occasions uses musical terminology for direct analogy in understanding his ideas on propositional language. For example:

“3.141: A proposition is not a blend of words. – (Just as a theme in music is not a blend of notes.) A proposition is articulate.”

This is a rather tame analogy that doesn’t necessarily highlight the nature of the connection between propositional language and musical language. About this analogy, James Feilding states:

“What it means to be articulate in this sense is that a proposition (or score) gives us a clear picture of what is represented therein” 

But this alone can’t be what is suggested by the articulateness of music as, conceivably, even an incoherent blend of notes written in notation would give a clear idea of what that blend of notes represents. For example Cage’s indeterminate and inarticulate ‘Imaginary landscape IV for 12 radios’ does not lose sense due to inarticulacy, part of what is being conveyed is precisely this indeterminate and inarticulate form. Furthermore, this analysis doesn’t get to the heart of the issue, the question that is skipped over is just that; what is it in music that is being represented at all? Wittgenstein gives (albeit not much) elaboration on this connecting factor between music and language. In his notes prior to the full forming of the Tractatus he asserts that:

“A tune is a kind of tautology, it is complete in itself; it satisfies itself.” 

Is this again a purely metaphorical connection to communicate a fact about propositional language? Or, does this say something significant about what Wittgenstein thought specifically about music. Assuming that this small quote does indeed reflect a view on specifically musical language, we can interpret it in two ways. The first way it can be read is by interpreting the word “tune” to specifically relate to a melody or harmonic series in a musical piece. In this sense perhaps we can imagine that music is analogous to propositional language in the sense that some of the arrangements of its constituents yield tautologies whilst others may not. This specific separation of harmonic tune to other components of music is a notion shared by Cage, perhaps alluding to similar view of musical meaning. Cage notes that:

“Sound has for characteristics: pitch, timbre, loudness, and duration. The opposite and necessary coexistent of sound is silence. Of the four characteristics of sound, only duration involves both sound and silence. Therefore, a structure based on durations (rhythmic: phrases, time lengths) is correct (corresponds with the nature of the material), whereas harmonic structure is incorrect (derived from pitch, which has no being in silence).” 

In a Tractarian reading, perhaps we can assert that what Cage means as “incorrect” in this sense is tautological as it does not shut out nor point towards any specific point of sense in music, which in Cage’s view is silence. In fact this carries on rather neatly from the previous connection between silence and logical form as Cage’s notion of “the nature of the material” further supports the connection of silence being some type of logical form for music. 

Admittedly, this whole connection is rather arbitrary and once again has an air of superficiality as it doesn’t quite satisfy as a full account of musical meaning. But this was only the first interpretation, the second (which is rather the more likely of the two) is that when Wittgenstein says “tune” he is really generalising and means to say ‘music in general’. Through this interpretation, we garner a more complete idea of Wittgenstein’s Tractarian approach to music. If we say that all music is tautological, what can be reduced from this claim is that music says nothing and represents nothing; all that music does is show the nature of it’s own structure. This is appropriately the exact same function tautologies have in Wittgenstein’s theory of propositional language. Music, by this interpretation of Wittgenstein Tractarian ideas, can be seen as a world in itself, separate from the reality that propositional language connects to. Music can be seen as it’s own formal system, yet with no possibility of translation. It can be spoken and understood, yet it exists vastly disconnected from the reality of propositional language. This formalist interpretation does yield a seemingly complete explanation of musical meaning , yet it seems unsatisfying. Questions can be posed on the nature of this disconnect from the reality of propositional language as this feels an odd and almost arbitrary distinction. It can also be questioned that if music is tautological in it’s entirety, then what is the nature of the logical system that these tautologies demarcate; what are these supposed rules and logical systems of musical communication? It seems that whatever rule we can conjure about the composition of music can be broken and yet the composition itself can still maintain the essence of musical meaning. Of all people, it is John Cage who cements this idea. Cage notes:

“Intervals have meaning; they are not just sounds but they imply in their progressions a sound not actually present to the ear. Tonality. I never liked tonality. I worked at it. Studied it. But i never had any feeling for it: for instance: there are some progressions called deceptive cadences. The idea is this: progress in such a way as to imply the presence of a tone not actually present; then fool everyone by not landing on it – land somewhere else. What is being fooled? Not the ear but the mind.” 

Cage here seems still to be in line with the formalist nature of the previous Tractarian interpretation, merely showing hints of a dislike for this system. It becomes apparent that this system is unsatisfactory, however, in the proceeding lines of the text:

“However, modern music still fascinated me with all its modern intervals. But in order to have them, the mind had fixed it so that one had to avoid having progressions that would make one think of sounds that were not actually present to the ear. Avoiding did not appeal to me. I began to see that the separation of mind and ear had spoiled the sounds, – that a clean slate was necessary. This made me not only contemporary, but “avante-garde.” I used noises. They had not been intellectualized; the ear could hear them directly and didn’t have to go through any abstraction about them. I found that I liked noises even more than I liked intervals.” 

When Cage breaks these ‘rules’ or logical notions of musical meaning, such as tonality, we do not jump to say that this revokes its status of ‘music’. Rather, we label it, as Cage states, as “avante-garde”. We can imagine this with every conceivable ‘rule’ of music; the rules of rhythm, key, tonality, pitch etc. can all be broken in composition whilst still maintaining said compositions musical sense. It seems as though this formalist analytic style of approach to musical meaning doesn’t sit well with Cage’s practical experimentation. How can we reconcile this idea of removing sound from any notion of order and structure and still being left with music? Common ground between Wittgenstein’s strict formalism in the Tractatus and the wider ‘informal’ musical philosophy of Cage can perhaps be found in the theories of the later Wittgenstein in ‘Philosophical Investigations’, the Wittgenstein concerned with language games and contextual linguistic meaning. For this later Wittgenstein, a great shift took place in his conception of linguistic meaning. Meaning no longer relied on language’s connection to a separate underlying reality, rather it relied on language’s contextual use governed by rules (which come about through it’s contextual use). 

	We may first be tempted, however, to take a leap far away from Wittgenstein’s formalist sentiment and make a claim such as: What is meaningful in music is the emotions and state of minds that arise when listening to it, and so to ‘understand’ a piece of music is to experience the intended state of mind or the state of mind of the composer whilst creating the piece. This idea even seems to satisfy a connection between Cage and the later Wittgenstein; Cage frequently talks along the lines of music’s purpose being to 

“set the soul in operation”

and Wittgenstein talks about facial expressions and the meaning of them being in that we recognise a sense of experience in the other. The reason why

“A smiling mouth only smiles in a human face”

is perhaps because of the meaningful state of mind that lies behind the smile. However this understanding feels incongruous in light of the previous discussions on meaning as, if we say that the meaning of music is to cause in us emotions of joy or sadness or angst then it can be said that we can replace the act of listening to a piece of music with the experiencing of these certain emotions and be equally as satisfied. This seems obviously not the case.

	With this, we can return to the contextual use of music alike to the contextual use of language in Wittgenstein’s language games. In a language game, Wittgenstein suggests that a word only has meaning based on its rule-governed use in context of the ‘game’ that is being played. Perhaps, to highlight the way in which a musical ‘language game’ could occur, we can turn to a concise and precise system of music that Cage would have been familiar with: Schoenberg's 12 tone system (as Cage was a dedicated student of Schoenberg’s). This 12 tone system, in light of the previous Tractarian approach to musical understanding, would lack complete musical sense as the ‘rules’ of the system take steps in avoiding the conventional ideas of harmony and tonality. Cage states:

“the twelve-tone system – the nonstructural character of which forces its composer and his followers continually to make negative steps: He has always to avoid those combinations of sound that would refer too banally to harmony and tonality”

Glenn Gould (a renowned Canadian classical pianist) talks precisely on the nature of musicality in Schoenberg's 12 tone system:

“The line dividing tonality from the appearance of tonally reminiscent sequences is not always easy to define in Schoenberg's later works, because the arbitrary selection of motivic material upon which he settled as sponsor of his twelve-tone structures tends with the later works to become more dependent upon interval connections which, if not in themselves tonally reminiscent, are at least triadically reminiscent. Schoenberg's fondness for the sort of row that would provide him with a series of triad forms was prompted less by an interest in triads per se than by a concern for finding twelve-tone situations in which the two halves of the row would not only be complementary in terms of their division of the chromatic scale but would also emphasise similar interval combinations within both antecedent and consequent portions. The reasons for this concern with interval duplication can be summarised as a desire to achieve total chromatic equilibrium while concentrating upon stringently controlled motivic resources: in effect, the principle of diversity within unity that governs practically all of Schoenberg's works is here expressed in terms peculiar to twelve- tone organisation.”

What is to be understood here is that the seemingly tonal or “triadic” sequences created during a Schoenberg 12 tone row do not arise because of an underlying conventional reality of music, they come about because of the internal relationships of notes specifically within Schoenberg’s 12 tone system. In essence, it would be a misunderstanding of Schoenberg’s piece to appreciate the triadic and tonal tendencies in the context of traditional western tonality, as this would be entering the realm of a completely separate ‘language game’ so to speak, within which Schoenberg’s piece loses it’s musical sense. Perhaps for a simpler example which in fact can be explained within the conventions of western tonality: 

Take the chord progression Cmaj7 - Fmaj7/C - Gmaj7 (where the ‘/C’ fully replaces the F root note in the second chord. Based on musical convention it would be assumed that we are within the key of C as C is the starting chord with a major 7 (which can only be used on either the tonic [1st] or the subdominant [4th] chords of a key). The second chord seems to enforce this key of C as Fmaj7 is the 4th and the only other chord in the key that can be played with a major seventh. It is essential to note that whilst the chord Fmaj7/C will not actually have an F note within the chord (as it is replaced by the C), the F sound is fully implied by the nature of the previous chord. It then may come as something of a musical shock when the Gmaj7 is sounded as this is not within the key of C due to there being an F# sounding in the chord. We may immediately jump to say that this chord progression is ‘wrong’ by Western musical convention but surprisingly on closer inspection this chord progression does not break any rules of key, it just doesn't work within the ‘game’ of C major. Shifting the musical perspective to the key of G major we can see that the first chord becomes the 4th and the third chord becomes the 1st. The Fmaj7/C (provide the C fully replaces the F note) is actually fully in the key of G. 

In this example, like in Wittgenstein’s later theories on language games, the chord progression only loses it’s sense when analysed through the wrong context or ‘game’. This is similar to why the later Wittgenstein thought that religious, ethical and metaphysical discussion often lacked sense; because it crossed an internal contextual boundary of language.

v.

Perhaps here, in coming to a conclusion, we can check in with the musical status of Cage’s silent piece based on the previous consideration of the later Wittgenstein’s philosophy. The reconciliation of Cage’s experimental musical tendencies with Wittgenstein’s strict formalism perhaps wasn’t necessary in the context of Cage’s silent piece. Part of the beauty of ‘4’33’ is that it actually adheres to the strict formalism of the early Witggenstein; it doesn’t actively break any musical convention and it’s composition is strictly in form with Western musical rule. This perhaps seems like an almost absurd statement considering the actual content of ‘4’33’, but it only indirectly defies musical convention, it’s content in and of itself doesn’t actually break any convention. In the closing notes here it may also be worth noting that Wittgenstein never himself thought a complete account of musical meaning was possible in the formal sense. 

“What is valuable in a Beethoven sonata? The sequence of notes? No, for it is, after all, one sequence among many. Indeed I would even go so far as to say that the feelings Beethoven had when composing this sonata were no more valuable than any other feelings. I would reply, that whatever I was told, I would reject, and that not because the explanation was false but because it was an explanation. If someone gives me a theory it would not interest me-for that would never be the object of my search.” 

Perhaps what both Cage and Wittgenstein share is this sense of submission to each of their subjects. The later Wittgenstein gives up an attempt at a formal explanation of language;

“And we may not advance any kind of theory ... We must do away with all explanation and description alone must take its place” 

Whilst John Cage submits to all musical articulation, giving up any sense of form or organisation to a pure and untampered silence.

	 And whilst we may never get rid of that air of superficiality about that comparison between music and language, there is an undoubted sympathy between Cage and Wittgenstein’s method. Perhaps we can say that they view their subjects from opposing angles; whilst Wittgenstein demarcates his subject from the inside out, tracing the silence from the linguistic sense and logical form within, Cage traces his starting from the outside, using the nonsense, the inarticulate, the random and the silent to trace what lies within these bounds. And perhaps, even deeper, lies a sense of paradox between the two. Wittgenstein, in the act of pruning the nonsense of factual discourse, inadvertently submits the whole of the Tractatus itself to nonsense – and so, to silence. 

	“6.54: My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognises them as nonsensical, when he has used them – as steps – to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.) He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.”

Cage, in parallel, accepts the paradoxical nature of his silent piece – he accepts that silence is both essential and non-existant.

	“I am here, and there is nothing to say. What we require is silence; but what silence requires is that I go on talking. But now there are silences and the words make – help make – the silences. I have nothing to say and I am saying it and that is poetry as I need it. This space of time is organised. We need not fear these silences, – we may love them.”

Whilst connections and analogies can be made to enlighten the individual ideas of Cage and Wittgenstein, what ultimately lies between them is the intimate connection between silence and meaning; silence as the boundary of music and non-music — sense and non-sense.
