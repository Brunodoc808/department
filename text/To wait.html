    <h1>To Wait</h1>
    <p>
       To wait, to wait,
       To see the resignations of the self. The shapeless,
       Formless harmony of birds
       To wit, to woe,
       Their names and consciousness confirms
       That that is, and is known
       Only by those
       Who've these thoughts on their own.
    </p>
