    <h1>Incline</h1>
    <p>
       Due to it's incline,
       This floor is no longer.
       It serves as a bench,
       By natural command.

       The gradient demands
       That it deserves more,
       Since the average treatment
       to that of a floor
       Isn't great.

       Darwin himself would surely sit,
       as he discovers his theories of evolution
       Onlu prove he was adopted.

       It insists you sit
       This 'more than a floor'
       Designed with purpose and room for error.

       And by natural command
       You take their hand.
